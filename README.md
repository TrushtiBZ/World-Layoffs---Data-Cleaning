# World Layoffs Data Cleaning Project

## Project Overview

### Aim
The primary aim of this project is to clean the World Layoffs dataset, ensuring it is of high quality for subsequent data storage, analysis activities, or ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline creation. The cleaning process involves several key steps, including data quality assessment, handling NULL and missing values, error identification and correction, removal of duplicate values, datatype standardization, and outlier detection and removal. Additionally, the project applies statistical knowledge to fix data errors.

### Dataset Description
The World Layoffs dataset (CSV file) focuses on layoff statistics of businesses operating between 2020 and 2023. The dataset contains 2,361 entries with fields like company, industry, laid off employee count and its ratio, date of laid off, and hierarchical stage in the company. It also includes information about the country, firmâ€™s location, and raised funds in millions. 

## Highlights of Data Cleaning Process

1. **Removed Duplicate Data**:
   - Utilized ETC to identify and remove duplicate records from the dataset, ensuring each entry is unique and accurate.

2. **Updated Data Type for Date Field**:
   - Converted the `Date of Layoff` field from text to a standardized date format, enabling better date-based analysis and querying.

3. **Standardized Data Entry**:
   - Standardized entries in the `Date of Layoff` and `Country` fields to maintain consistency across the dataset.

4. **Formatted Error Entries**:
   - Corrected formatting errors in the `Industry` and `Country` fields to ensure uniformity and accuracy in data representation.

5. **Updated NULL Values**:
   - Handled relevant NULL values in the dataset by imputing them with relevant statistical measures.

6. **Updated Blank Data Using Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Filled in missing data using descriptive statistics concepts to provide reasonable estimates for blank entries, ensuring the dataset's completeness and reliability.

## Results and Learnings

### Results
- **Improved Data Quality**: The dataset now features accurate, consistent, and standardized entries, making it suitable for advanced analysis and integration into ETL pipelines.
- **Enhanced Data Integrity**: Removal of duplicates and correction of errors have significantly enhanced the integrity and reliability of the dataset.
- **Ready for Analysis**: The cleaned dataset is now ready for various analytical tasks, providing a solid foundation for generating insights on world layoffs.

### Learnings
- **Data Cleaning Techniques**: Gained hands-on experience in essential data cleaning techniques such as handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and correcting errors.
- **SQL Proficiency**: Improved SQL skills, particularly in using MySQL Workbench for complex data manipulation tasks.
- **Statistical Application**: Applied statistical methods to address data quality issues, reinforcing the importance of statistics in data cleaning.
- **Attention to Detail**: Developed a keen eye for detail, essential for identifying and correcting subtle errors within the dataset.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the critical steps involved in cleaning a dataset, ensuring its suitability for further analysis and integration. The refined World Layoffs dataset now serves as a reliable source of information, providing valuable insights into layoff trends across various industries and regions during the 2020-2023 period. The skills and knowledge gained from this project will be instrumental in future data analysis and ETL endeavors.
